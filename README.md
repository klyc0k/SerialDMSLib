SerialDMSLib
============

SerialDMSLib is a transportation specific library for controling 
Dynamic Message Signs (DMS). This library provides getting and setting 
messages to older DMS devices which are connected in Serial Port (RS232), and
follows the NTCIP 1203 (National Transportation Communications for Intelligent Transportation System) standard.

The SerialSNMP class provides an interface for building, sending, 
and receiving SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol) command streams through serial ports. 
Feel free to apply and extend for any other device control issues.
The SNMP packets are handled by SnmpSharpNet library (http://www.snmpsharpnet.com/).
SeralSNMP only focus on SNMP communications through serial ports.
